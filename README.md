# POSIX-Threads-dining-philosophers-problem

The dining philosophers problem states that there are 5 philosophers sharing a circular table and they eat and think alternatively. There is a bowl of rice for each of the philosophers and 5 chopsticks. A philosopher needs both their right and left chopstick to eat. A hungry philosopher may only eat if there are both chopsticks available.Otherwise a philosopher puts down their chopstick and begin thinking again.

The dining philosopher is a classic synchronization problem as it demonstrates a large class of concurrency control problems.
